# Integer Compression

This repository contains implementations of several lightweight integer compression schemes, such as Delta encoding, Frame-Of-Reference (FOR) encoding and BitPacking, among others.
Additionally, this project allows to run more heavyweight, general-purpose compression techniques such as LZ4, Snappy, Zstd and BtrBlocks.

These implementations are used as a basis for comparison with a prototype of the "TinyBlocks" compression technique that I am currently researching.
